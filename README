This is custom implementation of subset of Oberon System 3:
	Reals (partial)
	Texts (partial, some changed)
	Files (re-implemented)
	Oberon (re-implemented)
	Display (part of interface only, to support Oberon.Log)
	Sets (no changes)

NOTES:
	Oberon.Par access via file "par"
	Oberon.GetSelection and Oberon.MarkedText via file with name specified in 1st arg of command line

TODO:
	Files:
		Old:
			if file already open, return it's descriptor instead of opening file twice
			except anonymous (temporary) files

	tests:
		OFiles (especially, Rename)
		Reals
		Texts

NOTES:
	Original modules (*.Mod) was taken from A2 distribution
	Files renamed to OFiles to avoid conflict with OBC Files
	A2:Reals = Oberon:Reals (2012.01)
